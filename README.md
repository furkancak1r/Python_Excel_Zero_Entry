# Python_Excel_Zero_Entry
 This Python script updates an Excel file using `openpyxl`. It loads a workbook, selects a specified sheet, and fills empty cells in columns G and H with 0 for rows 1 to 2340. If the sheet is not found, it notifies the user. Finally, it saves the updated workbook. An example demonstrates how to use the function with a file path and sheet name.
